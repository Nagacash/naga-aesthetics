<div class="pagearea">
    <p>Micropigmentation is a cosmetic procedure whereby pigments are applied into the
        uppermost layer of the scalp to simulate the appearance of hair follicles. Even
        up close, the dots of pigment look like natural hair follicles, creating the
        illusion of close-shaven hair.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The pigment strengths can be perfectly matched to different hair
        colours and skin tones. This makes it possible to treat every shade from very
        pale and fair skin tones through to dark skin. And blonde, red or grey hair are
        no problem either. A course of scalp micropigmentation usually takes three to
        four sessions. A session in our treatment room usually lasts between one and
        three hours, depending on the amount of work required.</p>

    <h3 id="heading1-2" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Does scalp
        micropigmentation look real?</h3>


    <p class="mb-4">Scalp micropigmentation dots correspond to the average size of a
        human hair, which makes them look deceptively real. Many of our clients get used
        to the result so quickly that they soon forget how advanced their hair loss was
        before. This also means that, in everyday life, only an informed and practised
        eye would be able to detect the difference and the transition between real hair
        and pigments, even up close. Of course, although the pigments are not noticeable
        in themselves, the people around you may see a positive change in you thanks to
        your altered appearance, more positive vibe and greater self-confidence.</p>

    <h3 id="heading1-3" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">How long does
        micropigmentation last?</h3>

    <p>It’s important to be aware that everyone is different, and everyone’s skin is
        unique. This means that the exact lifespan of your scalp micropigmentation is
        impossible to predict. To maximise the lifespan of your scalp micropigmentation,
        we recommend that you always
        take good care of your scalp</a>. Above all, this
        means using adequate sun protection at all times. In very strong sunlight, you
        should either use suncream with a high sun protection factor or wear a head
        covering.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Scalp micropigmentation lasts a lifetime. The pigments do fade over
        time, but they will never entirely disappear. This natural fading, however,
        means most people want to refresh their micropigmentation every three to five
        years, and come back to see us again. Other providers claim that
        micropigmentation only needs refreshing every eight to ten years or more. But if
        you want your micropigmentation to look perfect, this time frame is unrealistic.
        Of course, after eight to ten years the pigments will still be there in your
        scalp, but they will no longer be intense enough to give you the fuller-haired
        look you want.</p>

    <h3 id="heading1-4" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Will my scalp
        micropigmentation fade?</h3>

    <p>The intensity of any micropigmentation fades over time. This process is normal
        and cannot be prevented.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">After completing a course of scalp micropigmentation, you’ll be able
        to enjoy the results of your treatment for a long time to come. It will be
        several years before you see any noticeable fading. Thanks to our extensive
        experience with the correct micropigmentation technique and needle choice, the
        required pressure and above all the perfect pigment, we can offer optimal and
        long-lasting scalp micropigmentation.</p>


    <h3 id="heading1-5" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">What should I do when
        my scalp micropigmentation fades?</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">For an optimal high-contrast appearance, scalp micropigmentation
        usually needs refreshing every three to five years. For
        most of our clients, this can be done in just one sitting – only in very rare
        cases is a second session needed. Our pricing systemis
        designed in such a way that you’ll get an estimate beforehand of roughly how
        long your session will take. You’ll then make payment at the end of the session.
        The length of the wp-versionsher session will be roughly the same as one session
        of
        your original treatment. Our experience enables us to make very realistic
        estimates of how long a session will take, so that there are no unpleasant
        surprises when you come to pay. The first refresher session will be needed after
        three to five years at the earliest.</p>

    <h3 id="heading1-6" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Which pigments are
        used? Are the pigments safe?</h3>


    <div itemprop="text">
        <p>The colours we use consist of only one pigment, unlike most tattoo and
            permanent makeup colours which usually consist of many different pigments.
            These different pigments can change over time, and tip towards a cold or a
            warm tone, for example. Colours like this must never be used in scalp
            micropigmentation, because the stability of the different pigment components
            in the colours is unpredictable.</p>
        <p>Scalp micropigmentation practitioners worldwide use carbon black as a
            single-tone pigment, because shaved hair also looks single-tone, or
            monochrome. The individual hair colour can’t be seen until the hair has
            grown a few millimetres out of the skin. Before that it just looks light or
            dark depending on the hair colour. So with our finely graduated colour
            scale, we can find the perfect tone for any hair colour. Carbon black has a
            natural organic source. The colour pigments have no side effects and are
            anti-allergenic and dermatologically tested. Pigments of the same quality
            and class are also used as food colourings. None of our clients has ever had
            an allergic reaction, and no such reaction has ever been recorded by other
            scalp micropigmentation practitioners anywhere in the world since 2001. Nor
            have there been any known allergic reactions to carbon black pigment in
            other products (like mascara, for example).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">A patch test can still be useful to rule out potential risks if
            you have problematic or very sensitive skin, or if you have any allergies or
            intolerances. During the test, a small area is pigmented to rule out
            potential reactions to micropigmentation across a larger area. We’ll be
            happy to carry out this test for you if you like.</p>

        <h3 id="heading1-7" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Can scalp
            micropigmentation be removed?</h3>
        <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Thanks to the precision of the technique and the pigments we use, scalp
                micropigmentation can be removed. This is done with a special laser which is
                used exclusively for removing pigments from skin.</p>
            <p>Using intense bursts of heat, the laser beam splits up the pigments into the
                tiniest particles possible. These can then be taken away by the lymphatic
                system. The laser only responds to micropigmented skin and does not attack
                unpigmented areas. Because correctly performed professional scalp
                micropigmentation does not sit as deep under the skin as a tattoo, the removal
                process is a lot easier. If you want to have your scalp micropigmentation
                corrected or removed, you will not need nearly as many sessions as for a tattoo
                removal – which usually takes seven or more sittings.</p>
            <p>But please be aware that poorly executed scalp micropigmentation often sits
                deeper under the skin. When scalp micropigmentation has been done badly, it
                takes at least as many sessions to remove it as it does to remove a traditional
                tattoo, if not more.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Have you had bad scalp micropigmentation from another provider?
                We’ll be happy to help you find the best way forward. Because not all
                poor-quality scalp micropigmentation has to be removed. We can often help you
                achieve the result you want without using a laser, simply by applying correct
                scalp micropigmentation over the top of what you already have.</p>

            <h3 id="heading1-8" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Is scalp
                micropigmentation painful?</h3>
            <div itemprop="text">
                <p>People have different pain thresholds. Everyone has their own definition of
                    pain
                    and experiences it more or less intensely. Many clients say they don’t find
                    our
                    treatment very painful at all. Some clients have even been known to fall
                    asleep
                    while we were treating the top of their head! The skin on the top of the
                    head
                    has relatively low sensitivity, particularly on the tonsure. The areas
                    around
                    the temples, the hairline, the neck and the sides of the head are a little
                    more
                    sensitive. The latter two areas are often pigmented in people with alopecia
                    areata, alopecia totalis, alopecia universalis, FUT hair transplant scars or
                    sparse FUE donor areas. When we get to the sensitive areas, we’re happy to
                    take
                    breaks if you need them.</p>
                <p>We ask our clients throughout the procedure how they’re feeling, and almost
                    all
                    of them say that on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 is a light scratch and 10 is
                    the
                    worst pain you can imagine), they would rate the pain at between 2 and 5. In
                    comparison, clients with tattoos rate the pain of getting a tattoo at
                    between 7
                    and 10.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Another difference between micropigmentation and tattoos is how
                    long
                    they take to heal. Micropigmentation heals after a few days. After a tattoo
                    it
                    takes a lot longer for the skin to stop feeling sore or irritated. We do
                    recommend, however, that you avoid heavy sweating and exercise for at least
                    a
                    week after your micropigmentation in order to
                    minimise the risk of inflammation and get the most out of your session. If
                    you’re careful for the first few days, there’s less of a risk that the
                    pigments
                    will run or fade too much.</p>


                <h3 id="heading1-9" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">Can you
                    treat and
                    conceal FUT scars using scalp micropigmentation? And is this possible after
                    FUE hair
                    transplants too?</h3>
                <div itemprop="text">
                    <p>There are two different types of hair transplant: FUT (Follicular
                        Unit
                        Transplantation) and FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction). Both
                        methods leave scars.
                        With the so-called “strip method” (FUT), the scar is longer and
                        much more
                        noticeable, because a strip of skin (with the hair attached to
                        it) is removed
                        and the resulting wound is stitched up. FUE, on the other hand,
                        leaves behind
                        lots of tiny little scars across a larger area. These scars make
                        the hair look
                        thinner. Scalp micropigmentation is perfect for concealing scars
                        of any kind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">How well the scar can be concealed depends on its
                        size and its
                        condition. With FUT strip scars in particular, it depends on the
                        length of the
                        surrounding hair. The ideal hairstyle is either close-shaven or
                        a longer length
                        that means the scars can be covered by your own hair. Scalp
                        micropigmentation
                        will make your scar much less noticeable and in many cases
                        invisible to those
                        around you.</p>

    <h3 id="heading1-10" class="mr-4 ml-5 d-inline-block" itemprop="name">How much does
        scalp micropigmentation cost?
        <div itemprop="text">
            <p>The cost of scalp micropigmentation depends on the extent of a client’s
                hair
                loss, and is assessed on a case-by-case basis. The cost will be partly
                determined by the size of the area to be treated, for example. The best
                thing to do is to send us some photos beforehand. Using these pictures,
                we’ll be able to estimate how much work your treatment will involve. The
                price of a FUT scar correction will depend on the length and width of
                the
                scar. A refresher session is always cheaper than the original treatment,
                because it takes a lot less time.</p>
